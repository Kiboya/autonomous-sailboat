# Sailboat details

## Introduction

This document provides detailed measurements of the sailboat used in the project, with all dimensions given in meters. These measurements are essential for physical modeling, performance simulation, and ensuring compliance with International One Metre (IOM) class regulations. The data covers all key structural and functional components of the sailboat, including the mast, sails, hull, keel, and rudder.

Each measurement is presented alongside the official IOM class rules, serving as a reference to assess the model’s conformity and to guide potential design optimizations.


### Mast and Sails
Mast height: 1.20 m
Mainsail height (luff): 1.18 m
Mainsail foot length (bottom edge): 0.35 m


### Jib (Headsail)
Jib height (luff): 0.90 m
Jib foot length (bottom edge): 0.34 m
Jib leech length (trailing edge): 0.98 m

### Rudder
Height: 0.22 m
Chord length (bottom edge): 0.06 m
Trailing edge length: 0.17 m

## Keel
Height: 0.32 m
Width: 0.08 m

## Hull
Hull width (beam): 0.16 m
Hull height (depth): 0.13 m

**What We Have (From the IOM Class Rules)**

### **1. Geometry & Mass**

- **Boat Length (LOA):** 1.0 m
- **Draft:** 370–420 mm
- **Hull Depth:** ≥ 60 mm
- **Boat Weight:** ≥ 4 kg
- **Keel Weight:** 2200–2500 g
- **Rudder Weight:** ≤ 75 g

### **2. Sail Dimensions (For My B-Rig Mainsail)**

- **Leech Length:** 1200–1210 mm
- **Foot Length:** 340–350 mm
- **Headsail (B-rig)**:
    - **Luff Length:** 980–990 mm
    - **Foot Length:** 340–350 mm

### **3. Hydrodynamic Constraints**

- **Keel Max Width:** 20 mm
- **Keel & Rudder cannot be connected or articulated**
- **Materials:** Keel/Rudder material density must be ≤ lead (11340 kg/m³)
